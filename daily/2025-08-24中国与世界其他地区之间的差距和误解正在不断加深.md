Thursday morning, one of my friends in Shanghai told me that her application for an American F1 visa had been denied, the university promised her to hold the postion for her for next year. During a 20-minute call, I could clearly sense how depressed she was. She had devoted a great deal of time to preparing, both for her English courses and for her academic major. When I asked what reason she believed the consulate gave, she answered: intention for immigration. Late that night, I read a post on my WeChat moments from another person who had also been denied a visa, this time by British authorities. After a prolonged period of "wolf warrior" diplomacy, more and more people seem to be affected. It has become increasingly clear that the gap between China and the rest of the world is continuing to deepen.
周四早上，我在上海的一位朋友告诉我，她的美国 F1 签证申请被拒绝了，大学承诺她明年会为她担任该职位。 在20分钟的通话中，我能清楚地感觉到她有多么沮丧。她投入了大量时间来准备她的英语课程和她的学术专业。当我问她相信领事馆给出的理由是什么时，她回答说：移民的意图。 那天深夜，我在微信朋友圈上读到了另一个人也被拒绝签证的人发来的帖子，这次是被英国当局拒绝的。经过长时间的“战狼”外交，似乎越来越多的人受到影响。越来越明显的是，中国与世界其他地区之间的差距正在不断加深。 [#VISA](https://x.com/hashtag/VISA?src=hashtag_click) [#Chinese](https://x.com/hashtag/Chinese?src=hashtag_click) [#America](https://x.com/hashtag/America?src=hashtag_click) [#F1](https://x.com/hashtag/F1?src=hashtag_click)
