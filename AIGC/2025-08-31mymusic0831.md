<!--EndFragment-->[Verse]
Wires tangle in the dark
Sparks are dancing
Leave a mark
Error code
A digital bite
Something's wrong
But it feels so right

[Chorus]
System's breaking
Breaking down
But the rhythm’s all around
Glitch me once
Glitch me twice
This chaos feels kinda nice

[Verse 2]
Binary whispers in the void
Bits and bytes are now destroyed
I’m a pixel in your haze
Lost in this electric maze

[Bridge]
Reboot the night
Reset the sky
Every error makes me high
Control alt delete
I’m alive
In the crash
I learn to thrive

[Chorus]
System's breaking
Breaking down
But the rhythm’s all around
Glitch me once
Glitch me twice
This chaos feels kinda nice
