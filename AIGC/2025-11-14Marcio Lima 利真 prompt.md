An ultra closeup (approx 2 cm away) photorealistic, 3/4 view, above (approximately 4 cm above-the-subject) image of a minute mechanical dull silver panel shelled dragon nano bot that fills most (approximately 3/4) of the composition. It has microscopic visible electronics (micro circuit board, wiring, dim amber lights and micro integrated circuit components) within the shell gaps of the semi transparent dark plastic body (all electronics are within the body shell). It has futuristic micro cameras for eyes with an internal ring of dim amber sectioned lights and exactly four classic long visible wings. The mechanical details dramatically reveal minuscule hydraulics in the bends of the visible leg joints, a segmented maw with nano-scale fangs, and internal details behind the camera lenses. It is held delicately by the leg between the fingertips of the index finger and thumb by a hand rendered with distinctive clarity of their fingerprints and micro pores. Use a low focal point and short focal length so that the background lab surroundings are out of focus.
